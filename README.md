## Installation 
The code was ran Anaconda's python distribution on Jupyter Notebook. The python version used
was 3.8.8. However, no issues should be encoutered if using python 3+.

## Project Motivation
As someone who has a bachelor's degree not related to tech, I found pretty interesting
the idea of understading all the recomendations and background from Developers in Australia
on how to break into the field.

Some of my questioning were about: 
1. What type of study should I focus if I want to break into the field?
2. Do I need to have higher education degree?
3. Do people find formal education to be an effective method in progressing in a tech
career?

All of this and more were able to be broken down with the dataset used.

## File Description 
There are 2 .csv files. One with the data itseld and the other one is a schema for the columns.
There's a requirement.txt with all the libraries and version used.
And finally, there's the jupyter notebook with the data cleaning and wrangling.

## Results

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@laioespinheira/how-do-australian-developers-suggest-you-break-into-the-field-4f25969fbf8c).
